# Orden 

NFTs are a revolution in the digital creative space and it's only going to be on an upward trajectory. While makers and creators like this need to make this space look exciting and accessible to anyone and everyone. This is where ORDEN comes in. An NFT Platform for creators to create, mint, and sell their skills. It's a creative space for everyone. We call it a planet of our own. It also has a browser extension that acts as an explorer for NFT enthusiasts. Users can even mint fractional NFTs.


Orden is a platform for artists and creators to engage with their audiences by the means of the NFT Universe.
Creators stand a chance to earn badges for engagement with their audience. Creators can link their social media accounts, they earn rewards (Badges in the form of NFTs) based on engagement and other milestones.
